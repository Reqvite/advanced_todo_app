## Installation and launch of the project

### `npm i`

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Build the project for production.\

### `npm run preview`

It uses Vite to create a production build and serves it locally for previewing.\

### `npm run type-check`

It runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc) in type-checking mode. This command checks the TypeScript code for type errors without emitting any compiled output.\

### `npm run lint:ts`

It uses ESLint to lint TypeScript files (_.ts and _.tsx) within the src directory.\

### `npm run lint:ts:fix`

Similar to the previous script, it uses ESLint to lint TypeScript files, but it also includes the --fix flag, which tells ESLint to automatically fix any fixable linting errors it encounters.\

### `npm run theme`

Generate TypeScript types to provide autocomplete for your custom theme.
